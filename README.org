sr-speedbar -- Speedbar window in the same frame.

As of <2024-03-10 Sun 16:20> what is on MELPA and what is in doom is way too old
and does not work right with emacs-28. So, i found this working version from
emacswiki.org and am capturing it here for now. I hope that this turns out
to be an interim meausre.
